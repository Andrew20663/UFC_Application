# UFC_Application

This is my streamlit project based on the Ultimate UFC Dataset which merged all public Kaggle UFC datasets. 
This project really interested me because I wanted to see if I could create a machine learning model that could potentially predict the winner of a match. 
In this dataset, I used the 'ufc-master.csv' file provided on Kaggle by user mdabbert. I will provide the link if you would like to learn more about the data itself. I also created a streamlit app that is user friendly if they wanted to play around with that as well with dynamic input settings. The final model that is used to classify the winner of a ufc match is a Gradient Boosting Classifier and I will show you the process in this project of how I arrived to this conclusion. I found out that while working on the app, my results were different compared to my notebook because I may have overfit the training data overall. I will 
continue to work on this and thank you very much. The final model had an accuracy of about 92%.
